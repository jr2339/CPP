The instructions and data are stored in a high-speed memory unit.

And the control unit fetches these instructions from memory, decodes them, 
and directs the system to execute the operations indicated by the instructions.

Those operations that are arithmetical or logical in nature are carried out using 
the circuits of the arithmetic-logic unit(ALU) of the CPU.

These operations are known as processing.
                                                CPU = Central Processing Unit
