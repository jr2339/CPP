The instructions and data are stored in a high-speed memory unit.

And the control unit fetches these instructions from memory, decodes them, 
and directs the system to execute the operations indicated by the instructions.

Those operations that are arithmetical or logical in nature are carried out using 
the circuits of the arithmetic-logic unit(ALU) of the CPU.

These operations are known as processing.

==================================================Major components of a computing system==================================

In contrast to the one-instruction-at-a-time operation by the CPU in the von Neumannn architecture, parallel processing computers improve
performance by employing two or more CPUS.The world's fastest supercompters employ thousands of CPU chips and for this reason are termed 
massively parallel processing computer.
Parallel computing, however, requires a very different programming strategy in order to make use of the power of systems with thousands of
processors.
